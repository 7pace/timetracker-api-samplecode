Timetracker REST API Sample Code
===================

This repo contains code samples for using the REST API's in Timetracker. The code is optimized to be simple and easy to understand.

The OData Connected Service Extension (http://odata.github.io/odata.net/#OData-Client-Code-Generation-Tool) has been used to build this code sample.
The T4 templates (ServiceReferences\Timetracker\TimetrackerProxy.tt, ServiceReferences\Timetracker\TimetrackerProxy.ttinclude) were modified since the original OData Connected Service Extension does not support spaces in the naming of entity members.
